                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                        operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                        be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                        additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="article_list">
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                            server.

                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                        does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
                        basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                        from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                    <p class="text">
                        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
                        common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                        dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                        individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
                        special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                        objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                        to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                        parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                    The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                        Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                        "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                        (lowercase).

                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                        identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                        characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                        Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
